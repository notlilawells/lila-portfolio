# **The Problem**

Northwestern University has one functional gym to service 8,000+ undergraduate students. Consequently, the gym (dubbed SPAC by students and faculty) is often **overcrowded and difficult to navigate**. Students often enter SPAC only to realize that the equipment they wish to use is unavailable -- and thus they are **unable to complete their workouts**. 

# **Our Solution**

***SPAC Track*** is an app that my team and I prototyped whose aim was to clearly and efficiently communicate gym trends to SPAC users and staff. By measuring gym equipment usage and trends in gym traffic, ***SPAC Track** offers Northwestern gym goers insights into (1) when they should go to the gym, (2) what workouts are possible with the equipment available, and (3) how to best plan their day around their health and fitness. 

# **My Role at a Glance**

I led a team of 6 in the following activities: 

> 1. Completing 6 user interviews with students who used SPAC (1) infrequently, (2) moderately, and (3) daily
> 2. Performing a heuristic evaluation and a comprehensive evaluation of user needs. 
> 3. Prototyping  a low-fidelity prototype of the app on Canva and a [high-fidelity prototype app on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1226693302589818696)
> 4. [Presenting the prototypes and user findings to 30+ stakeholders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljBE69et-Co). 


# **What I Did Specifically**

My activities specifically included the following: 

>1. Drafting the user interview questionnaire and personally interviewing 2 of the 6 candidates
>2. Leading the heuristic evaluation and evaluation of user needs study.
>3. Completing half of the low-fidelity Canva prototype.
>4. Completing 100% of the Figma prototype. 
>5. Creating the slides and writing the script for the final stakeholder presentation.
